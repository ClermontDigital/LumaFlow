LumaFlow is a sophisticated Home Assistant custom integration that automatically adjusts your smart lights to follow natural circadian rhythms. By synchronizing your lighting with astronomical sunrise and sunset times, LumaFlow creates a more comfortable and natural lighting environment that adapts throughout the day and evening, supporting your natural sleep-wake cycle.

## Core Capabilities

### 🌅 **Astronomical Synchronization**
- **Real-time Calculations**: Uses your Home Assistant location to calculate precise sunset/sunrise times daily
- **Seasonal Adaptation**: Automatically adjusts to changing daylight hours throughout the year
- **Geographic Accuracy**: Works reliably worldwide, including extreme latitudes with special handling
- **Configurable Timing**: Customizable sunset offset (-120 to +120 minutes) for personal preferences

### 🏠 **Intelligent Light Management**
- **Selective Control**: Only affects lights that are currently on - never turns lights on/off automatically
- **Immediate Adaptation**: When lights are turned on, they instantly adapt to the current circadian phase
- **Universal Compatibility**: Supports RGB lights, color temperature lights, and brightness-only white lights
- **Brand Agnostic**: Works with Philips Hue, LIFX, Shelly RGBW, and any Home Assistant-compatible smart lights

### 🎛️ **Advanced Override System**
- **Manual Override Detection**: Automatically detects when you manually adjust lights
- **Intelligent Restore**: Easy one-click restoration to current circadian cycle
- **Daily Reset**: Overrides automatically clear at midnight, returning to natural rhythm (per circadian science)
- **Granular Control**: Override individual lights or groups independently

### ⚙️ **Flexible Configuration**
- **Multi-step Setup**: Intuitive 3-step configuration process through Home Assistant UI
- **Customizable Ranges**: Set your preferred brightness (1-100%) and color temperature (2000-6500K) ranges
- **Transition Control**: Choose transition speeds (slow/moderate/fast) for comfort
- **Runtime Adjustments**: Modify settings anytime through Home Assistant options

### 🤖 **Home Assistant Integration**
- **Native Entities**: Switch and sensor entities for monitoring and control
- **Automation Ready**: Full integration with Home Assistant automations and scenes
- **Service Calls**: Programmatic control via services for advanced automation
- **Status Monitoring**: Real-time phase tracking and next transition timing

## How It Works

LumaFlow implements a scientifically-based circadian lighting system that mimics natural light patterns throughout the day. The system uses continuous calculations rather than discrete phases, ensuring smooth and natural transitions.

### 🔄 **Circadian Phases**

1. **Day Phase** (Sunrise to Sunset Offset)
   - **Brightness**: Maximum configured level (default 100%)
   - **Color Temperature**: Cool white (default 6500K)
   - **Purpose**: Supports alertness and productivity during daylight hours

2. **Sunset Transition** (Sunset Offset to +1 hour)
   - **Brightness**: Gradual decrease begins
   - **Color Temperature**: Starts warming from cool to neutral
   - **Purpose**: Signals the beginning of evening wind-down

3. **Evening Phase** (+1 to +4 hours after sunset)
   - **Brightness**: Linear decrease to minimum level
   - **Color Temperature**: Progressive warming to amber/red tones
   - **Purpose**: Prepares body for sleep by reducing blue light exposure

4. **Night Phase** (+4 hours after sunset to sunrise)
   - **Brightness**: Minimum configured level (default 1%)
   - **Color Temperature**: Warmest setting (default 2700K)
   - **Purpose**: Maintains minimal lighting without disrupting sleep

### ⚡ **Smart Activation**
- **Selective Control**: Only affects lights that are already turned on
- **Instant Adaptation**: Newly turned-on lights immediately adopt current circadian values
- **Respect Manual Control**: Lights manually turned off remain off
- **Daily Override Reset**: Manual adjustments automatically clear at midnight

### 🧮 **Mathematical Precision**
- Uses the **Astral** library for astronomical calculations
- Accounts for your exact geographic location and timezone
- Handles daylight saving time transitions automatically
- Manages extreme latitude edge cases (polar regions)

## Scientific Foundation

### 🧬 **Circadian Science**
LumaFlow is based on peer-reviewed research in chronobiology and circadian lighting:

- **Blue Light Regulation**: Gradually reduces blue light exposure in the evening to support natural melatonin production
- **Color Temperature Progression**: Mimics the natural progression from daylight (6500K) to candlelight (2700K)
- **Brightness Dimming**: Follows natural light intensity patterns to maintain circadian rhythm synchronization
- **Timing Precision**: Uses astronomical calculations rather than fixed schedules for geographic accuracy

### 💡 **Health Benefits**
- **Improved Sleep Quality**: Supports natural sleep-wake cycles by reducing evening blue light
- **Better Alertness**: Maintains bright, cool light during productive hours
- **Reduced Eye Strain**: Gentle transitions prevent harsh lighting changes
- **Mood Support**: Consistent light patterns can help regulate mood and energy levels

### 🏥 **Accessibility Features**
- **Customizable Intensity**: Accommodates various vision needs and preferences
- **Gradual Transitions**: Prevents sudden changes that might cause discomfort
- **Manual Override**: Allows immediate adjustment for specific needs
- **Automatic Reset**: Returns to healthy patterns daily without manual intervention

- Verify lights appear in Home Assistant Developer Tools > States
- Test light control manually before adding to LumaFlow
```

#### Integration Won't Load
```yaml
# Check Home Assistant logs for specific errors
# Common solutions:
- Restart Home Assistant after installation
- Verify custom_components folder structure
- Check that astral dependency installed correctly
```

### 🔧 **Configuration Problems**

#### Lights Not Responding to LumaFlow
```yaml
# Diagnostic steps:
1. Check switch.lumaflow is 'on'
2. Verify lights are currently turned on
3. Look for override status in sensor attributes
4. Check Home Assistant logs for light control errors
```

#### Incorrect Sunset/Sunrise Times
```yaml
# Verify location settings:
- Check Home Assistant Configuration > General
- Ensure latitude/longitude are correct
- Confirm timezone is properly set
- Restart LumaFlow integration after location changes
```

### 🔄 **Runtime Issues**

#### Manual Changes Not Detected
```yaml
# Override detection troubleshooting:
- Ensure 'Enable override detection' is turned on
- Manual changes may take up to 1 minute to detect
- Use lumaflow.restore_lights service to force restore
```

#### Transitions Too Fast/Slow
```yaml
# Adjust transition speed:
- Change via Configuration > Integrations > LumaFlow > Options
- Slow: 5 minutes, Moderate: 3 minutes, Fast: 1 minute
- Custom timing via automation and service calls
```
